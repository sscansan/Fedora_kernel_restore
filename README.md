1. Verify if /bin/bash Exists

It seems that the root filesystem (/mnt) might not be correctly mounted, or there's an issue with the directory structure.

1. Check the mounted partitions:

From the live USB, run the following to ensure your root filesystem (/dev/mapper/myroot) is mounted correctly:

sudo lsblk

This should show that /dev/mapper/myroot is mounted at /mnt.


2. Verify the files inside the chroot environment:

Check if /mnt/bin/bash exists:

ls /mnt/bin/bash

If the output is No such file or directory, it means the root filesystem wasn't properly mounted, or it's missing necessary files.

2. Recheck the Mounting Process

Make sure all necessary partitions are mounted correctly. Follow these steps:

1. Unlock the LUKS partition (if you haven't already):

sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme1n1p3 myroot


2. Mount the root partition: Mount the unlocked LUKS partition to /mnt:

sudo mount /dev/mapper/myroot /mnt


3. Check the contents of /mnt: Verify that /mnt/bin/bash exists:

ls /mnt/bin/bash

If /mnt/bin/bash is still missing, your root partition may not be mounted correctly.


4. Mount the boot partition:

sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p2 /mnt/boot


5. Mount the EFI partition (if applicable):

sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi




---

3. Bind Necessary Directories Before Chroot

If the root filesystem is properly mounted and /bin/bash exists, but chroot still fails, make sure you're binding the necessary directories:

1. Bind /dev, /proc, /sys, and /run to /mnt:

sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
sudo mount --bind /run /mnt/run


2. Try to chroot again:

sudo chroot /mnt




---

4. Alternative: Use /bin/sh Instead of /bin/bash

If /bin/bash is missing but /bin/sh exists, you can try using /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash as the shell for chroot.

To do this, run the following:

sudo chroot /mnt /bin/sh

This should allow you to access the chroot environment even if /bin/bash is not available.


---

5. Reinstall Kernel After Successful Chroot

Once inside the chroot environment (using either /bin/bash or /bin/sh), proceed to reinstall the kernel and update the GRUB configuration.

1. Update the system and reinstall the kernel:

sudo dnf update --refresh
sudo dnf reinstall kernel kernel-core kernel-modules


2. Rebuild the GRUB configuration:

sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg




---

6. Exit Chroot and Unmount

After making the necessary changes, exit the chroot environment and unmount the partitions:

1. Exit the chroot environment:

exit


2. Unmount the partitions:

sudo umount /mnt/run /mnt/sys /mnt/proc /mnt/dev /mnt/boot /mnt/boot/efi


3. Reboot:

sudo reboot




---

7. Verify the Kernel

After rebooting, verify that your system is running the correct kernel:

uname -r
