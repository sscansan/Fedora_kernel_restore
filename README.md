1. Ensure You Have the Correct Boot Partition

You mentioned that the boot partition is located on /dev/nvme1n1p2. Let's confirm the structure of your partitions again to ensure the boot partition is mounted in the right place.

1. Run the following command to verify your partitions:

sudo lsblk

Look for your /dev/nvme1n1p2 partition, which should be the boot partition.




---

2. Create the Correct Mount Point

Before mounting the boot partition, we need to make sure the /mnt/boot directory exists.

1. Make sure you're in the /mnt directory (or use it as the root of your mounted system):

cd /mnt


2. Create the /mnt/boot directory if it doesn't already exist:

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/boot




---

3. Mount the Boot Partition

Now that the /mnt/boot directory exists, mount your boot partition to this directory:

sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p2 /mnt/boot

If you also have a separate EFI partition (which is typically required for UEFI boot), ensure it's mounted correctly too. Here's how to mount the EFI partition:

1. Create the /mnt/boot/efi directory (if it doesn't exist already):

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi


2. Mount the EFI partition to /mnt/boot/efi:

sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi




---

4. Chroot and Continue with Kernel Reinstallation

Once the boot and EFI partitions are mounted correctly, you can proceed with the chroot process to reinstall the kernel:

1. Bind the necessary directories:

sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
sudo mount --bind /run /mnt/run


2. Chroot into the mounted system:

sudo chroot /mnt




---

5. Reinstall or Update the Kernel

Now that the partitions are mounted and you're inside the chroot, reinstall the kernel:

1. Refresh your package metadata:

sudo dnf update --refresh


2. Reinstall the kernel and necessary modules:

sudo dnf reinstall kernel kernel-core kernel-modules




---

6. Rebuild the GRUB Configuration

After reinstalling the kernel, rebuild the GRUB configuration to ensure your system boots correctly.

For UEFI systems, run:

sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg



---

7. Exit Chroot and Reboot

1. Exit the chroot environment:

exit


2. Unmount all partitions:

sudo umount /mnt/run /mnt/sys /mnt/proc /mnt/dev /mnt/boot /mnt/boot/efi


3. Reboot the system:

sudo reboot




---

8. Verify the Kernel

After rebooting, check that your system is running the correct kernel:

uname -r


---

â€“----------------
-----------------

1. Verify if /bin/bash Exists

It seems that the root filesystem (/mnt) might not be correctly mounted, or there's an issue with the directory structure.

1. Check the mounted partitions:

From the live USB, run the following to ensure your root filesystem (/dev/mapper/myroot) is mounted correctly:

sudo lsblk

This should show that /dev/mapper/myroot is mounted at /mnt.


2. Verify the files inside the chroot environment:

Check if /mnt/bin/bash exists:

ls /mnt/bin/bash

If the output is No such file or directory, it means the root filesystem wasn't properly mounted, or it's missing necessary files.




---

2. Recheck the Mounting Process

Make sure all necessary partitions are mounted correctly. Follow these steps:

1. Unlock the LUKS partition (if you haven't already):

sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme1n1p3 myroot


2. Mount the root partition: Mount the unlocked LUKS partition to /mnt:

sudo mount /dev/mapper/myroot /mnt


3. Check the contents of /mnt: Verify that /mnt/bin/bash exists:

ls /mnt/bin/bash

If /mnt/bin/bash is still missing, your root partition may not be mounted correctly.


4. Mount the boot partition:

sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p2 /mnt/boot


5. Mount the EFI partition (if applicable):

sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi




---

3. Bind Necessary Directories Before Chroot

If the root filesystem is properly mounted and /bin/bash exists, but chroot still fails, make sure you're binding the necessary directories:

1. Bind /dev, /proc, /sys, and /run to /mnt:

sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
sudo mount --bind /run /mnt/run


2. Try to chroot again:

sudo chroot /mnt




---

4. Alternative: Use /bin/sh Instead of /bin/bash

If /bin/bash is missing but /bin/sh exists, you can try using /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash as the shell for chroot.

To do this, run the following:

sudo chroot /mnt /bin/sh

This should allow you to access the chroot environment even if /bin/bash is not available.


---

5. Reinstall Kernel After Successful Chroot

Once inside the chroot environment (using either /bin/bash or /bin/sh), proceed to reinstall the kernel and update the GRUB configuration.

1. Update the system and reinstall the kernel:

sudo dnf update --refresh
sudo dnf reinstall kernel kernel-core kernel-modules


2. Rebuild the GRUB configuration:

sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg




---

6. Exit Chroot and Unmount

After making the necessary changes, exit the chroot environment and unmount the partitions:

1. Exit the chroot environment:

exit


2. Unmount the partitions:

sudo umount /mnt/run /mnt/sys /mnt/proc /mnt/dev /mnt/boot /mnt/boot/efi


3. Reboot:

sudo reboot




---

7. Verify the Kernel

After rebooting, verify that your system is running the correct kernel:

uname -r
